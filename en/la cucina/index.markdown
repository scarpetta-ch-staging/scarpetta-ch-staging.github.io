==============
At *Scarpetta* we use our passion for simplicity and flavour to serve seasonal and authentic Italian specialties. 
Every day we make our own fresh pasta as well as our own fresh bread. We only use local produce, and everything is hand-made. 

A fresh *cucina* sees us cook with the seasons. To view a sample menu, please [click here.] (/menus/MENU_nuova.pdf)
