==============

We serve seasonal and regional dishes inspired by our travels through Italy.
Our specialities include pasta and bread - all made ​​by hand. We choose our suppliers with great care and our ingredients are sourced locally (with the exception of some products from Italy).  

Our menu changes seasonally, but our values ​​remain the same: simplicity and flavour.
