> ### **fare la scarpetta;** taking a small piece of bread to mop up the sauce on your plate
=============================================================================================

***
Inspired by our journeys through *bella Italia*, and after having worked in some of London's most renowned kitchens (including the River Caf√© as well as Trullo and Bocca di Lupo), we sought to live our own dream: our own *Osteria*.

The *ambiente* of Scarpetta is to welcome you to the Italian *dolce vita*, informal and relaxing.
