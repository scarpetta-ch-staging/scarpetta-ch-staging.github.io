> ### **fare la scarpetta;** take a peice of bread and mop up the sauce from the bottom of your dish
========================================================================================================

***

La Scarpetta is a small restaurant in the hills of Tenero that offers simple and authentic Italian cuisine in the region of Ticino. 

From the work in some of the best restaurants in London (The River Caf√©, Trullo and Bocca di Lupo) and our trip to Italy we were inspired to develop our values based on simplicity and flavour. 

Our food is fresh and seasonal and La Scarpetta is appreciated for its casual and relaxed atmosphere.
