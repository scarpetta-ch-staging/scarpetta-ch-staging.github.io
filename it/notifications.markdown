	Luc and Kim. 
	You can use this file to put in notifications on the home page. :) This is the ITALIAN version
	You can put in as may as you like, I would recommend that you seperate them with *** as this will put in a nice horizontal line.
	So, for example:
	
	We will be closed for Chirstmas
	***
	We have no more chocolate cake because john ate it all 
	
	If you want to make any words in your notifications bold or italic, you can do the following:
	
	We will be closed for *Christmas* (surrounding the words with ONE * will make it italic)
	*** 
	We have no more chocolate cake because **John ate it all** (surrounding words with TWO * will make it bold)
	
You can put your notifications directly below this line {% endcomment %}
