When you want to change a menu

1. Save the menu in word ad a pdf, remembering to choose the location scarpetta-ch.github.io
	If this is not immediately obvious, make sure that you click the down arrow on the right hand side.
2. Once saved in this location, you will see that in Github there are pending changes to be synced and committed. 
	Choose a comment that is appropriate (not hi john, i did it :)) , and click the sync and commit button.
3. Your changes will shortly appear on the live site.

Have fun
